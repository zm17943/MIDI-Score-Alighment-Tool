# MIDI-Score-Alighment-Tool

This is my final project for Music 254 at Stanford, taught by Eleanor Selfridge-Field and Craig Sapp.

The main alighment tool "midi2score.cpp" is under "tools" folder, and thanks Craig for providing other codes for loading MIDI and humdrum files. Follow the steps below to align your MIDI and score:

### Preraration
You need one humdrum file for your score (See http://doc.verovio.humdrum.org for reference), and one MIDI file for the performance.

`conda install allennlp -c pytorch -c allennlp -c conda-forge`
